## Development in progress

Smart contract that is shared  here is not yet the final version. It is still being tested, tweaked and updated.

## About the project

Birdchain ingeniously combines three fields of practices: messaging app, A2P SMS service, and utility-based cryptocurrency.
Birdchain messaging app allows its users to sell their unused SMS to businesses. Businesses distribute their transactional and promotional SMS messages to customers through the phones of app users. Users are paid for their service with Birdchain cryptocurrency which is bought by a business.

Here is why Birdchain will succeed:

- Normally people do not send SMS to their friends, relatives, or acquaintances. They communicate through instant messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger, Viber, WhatsApp. Even though people do not send SMSs, operators include a limitless amount of SMS messages to their mobile plan and people pay for the service they do not even need.
- Businesses are drastically overpaying for SMS marketing and they are constantly looking for more reasonable prices. We will offer them a much cheaper, faster and more transparent service.
- We are simplifying the process for the people by making it financially attractive to the businesses. This is how Birdchain cryptocurrency gets additional demand and supply from the very beginning. 

## Benefit for the People

Revenue of A2P SMS market is estimated to be $63 billion in 2017 (globally). All users of Birdchain app will become “players” in this market and will receive their share. The more messages will be sent from their phone, the more they will earn. 
Birdchain app will work as any other instant messaging app - people will be able to use it to chat with their friends and family. When they want to sell their unused SMS messages via Birdchain, they will enable this feature in the settings.
Basic walkthrough how to start using Birdchain app:
1. Download Birdchain app;
2. Set Birdchain app as default messaging app;
3. In the app settings, allow the app to send transactional and promotional SMS messages;
4. Set the amount of SMS app can send.

No further interaction of the app user is necessary. App will send transactional and promotional SMS messages in the background automatically. And users will receive Birdchain tokens for every single SMS that was sent from their phone. 
We will develop a self-balancing distribution algorithm which will guarantee that all Birdchain users will have same odds of their phone to be chosen for SMS delivery. It will guarantee that everybody will get paid equally, fairly and transparently. More information about technical implementation of Birdchain can be found in the Technical section of this White Paper.

## Benefits for Businesses

Our idea will (r)evolutionize the market of SMS marketing. Today, when a company wants to reach its customers, it has to pay exorbitant price for distribution of the campaign. Moreover, every year, the prices for SMS messaging are increasing, and service quality is decreasing.
Birdchain will allow businesses to almost instantly distribute their campaigns and enjoy much lower prices. They will contact their customers all around the world and:
- Get a better price, no matter how big their campaigns are;
- The price will never exceed 80 percent of an average A2P SMS price in the same country;
- Get faster delivery;
- Get transparent pricing;
- Get a better service.
Basic walkthrough for companies to start using Birdchain service:
- Visit website of Birdchain service;
- Sign up;
- Purchase Birdchain tokens;
- Setup SMS campaign (upload contact list in .xlsx or other format, write message text);
- Place a bid (maximum price) for the campaign.

This is super easy and fast approach to sending out the first SMS campaign. In the first versions of service, Birdchain will deliver SMS messages at least as fast as the fastest aggregators today. In later versions, Birdchain will be significantly faster than other A2P SMS distribution services. 
The best part is that companies will be able to choose how much they want to spend on every campaign. For more information about price of Birdchain service, please read next section.

## Price for Business

Birdchain service for businesses will operate as an auction. It is the fairest solution for both: the businesses and the people. 
Company will have to set maximum amount of Birdchain tokens it want to spend on its campaign - bid. No matter how high/low bid company will set, the campaign will be delivered either way. Higher bid will mean that campaign will be distributed faster, and lower bid - not as fast. When setting up the campaign, Birdchain service will show the expected time of finishing campaign delivery, so our clients could fully plan their campaigns and expenses.

This feature will allow avoiding “traffic jams” and ensuring all SMS messages are delivered. It will also guarantees that all companies - even small and not too rich - will be able to exercise very effective SMS marketing.

Using Birdchain companies will be able to send two kinds of SMS messages: promotional and transactional:
- Promotional SMS messages will be delivered as company specified in its order;
- Transactional SMS messages will be send only when initiated by real-life events. For example, arrival of taxi or receiving money transfer. 

**Thanks to blockchain algorithms, the price of the Birdchain SMS will never exceed 80 percent of an average A2P SMS price in the same country.** 

## Global Basic Income

Main goal of Birdchain is to disrupt A2P SMS market with blockchain technology. Make it better, faster, more transparent and fair-priced. Although, soon it became very apparent that Birdchain will become a lot more than just a (r)evolutionary idea.

**Birdchain will be the first ever (in the history of the world!) non-governmental initiative to create Global Basic Income.**
 
Depending on a country and market activity users of Birdchain app will be able to earn 50-300 USD per month. It means that Birdchain will create basic passive income for its users globally. 

We see this feature as huge marketing opportunity and a chance to stand out in a global market of messaging apps.

## BTC token functionality

In order to further the development of the platform and get to the global market as soon as possible we are going to raise funding by running an ICO campaign.

Birdchain will issue 9,402,750,000  BCT tokens total, of which 43% will be put on sale. 
The base cost of tokens will depend on the popularity of the platform, and their holders.
Birdchain token is an A2P SMS distribution service and all owners of BCT are either users of the service, or resellers of the token.

Within the Birdchain ecosystem, the Birdchain token (BCT) will be used internally to buy or sell transactional and promotional SMS.
Businesses would be able to purchase BCT in exchanges, and then place bids for SMS campaigns they want to deliver, setting the bid in BCT token. The advertisers will bid for a specific number of SMS they want to send.

While our system is calculating the best price/delivery time option for an advertiser, the token will be frozen. They will remain frozen until our system receives confirmation that peers have completed their tasks. When that happens, paid tokens are transferred to the wallets of app users, minus fair commission fee for Birdchain service.
 
BCT token is developed on Ethereum’s blockchain and conform to the ERC20 Token Standard.

Important notes:
1. BCT tokens will be sent automatically back to the wallet from which the funds have been sent.
2. BCT tokens transactions will be limited till ICO end to prevent trading before the ICO ends.
3. Do not send ETH directly from cryptocurrency exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex etc.)!
4. We'll send back all ETH in case of minimal cap is not collected.
